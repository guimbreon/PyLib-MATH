# Basic Math Library

This is a basic math library that provides several functions for performing arithmetic operations on two numbers. It was created as part of an exercise in creating libraries.

## Installation

To use this library, simply import the module in your Python code:

	pip install git+https://github.com/guimbreon/PyLib-MATH
	
## Usage

After importing the library, you can use any of the following functions to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers:

	import MATH
	
	# Example usage
	result = MATH.Sum(3, 5)

The following functions are provided by this library:

    Sum(Num1, Num2): Returns the sum of Num1 and Num2.
    Sub(Num1, Num2): Returns the difference between Num1 and Num2.
    Mult(Num1, Num2): Returns the product of Num1 and Num2.
    Div(Num1, Num2): Returns the quotient of Num1 divided by Num2.
    Eleva(Num1, Num2): Returns Num1 raised to the power of Num2.
    Fibonacci(Number): Enter the number of the digit you want.
    Trend(list_number): Returns the most occured result.
    Mean(list_number): Returns the mean number.
    Max(list_number): Returns the highest value.
    Min(list_number): Returns the lowest value.
    Fact(number): Returns the value of the Factorail of that number.
    Sqrt(number): Returns the Square root of that number

For more information on each function, including the expected input and output, please refer to the documentation in the code.
